# Hi, I'm Jose! 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a background in the teaching industry. I believe we can make a **positive impact** in the society with Code, be it to your local community or in a bigger scale.
I love learning new skills at all times and thinking about new projects I could create. I enjoy the simple act of coding and **bringing my ideas to life**! 

I also have interest in Data Science and Applied Machine Learning to solve Real-World problems, so... please don't get too confused if you see some ML / AI repositories mixed in! 😝
